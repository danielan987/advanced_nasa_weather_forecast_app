# Advanced NASA Weather Forecast App by Future Clouds

## Project Summary
An app where users can obtain weather predictions for a location and dates they select for a trip they have in advance. 

## Project Demonstration

## Project Details
### Challenge
It is challenging to predict the weather months or years in advance. However, that is what's required when preparing for a trip in advance. We don't want it to be too hot or cold, too windy, raining or snowing too much, or even too humid or dry. Often, we have to guess and hope for the best.
